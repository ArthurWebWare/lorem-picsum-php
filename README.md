**Lorem Picsum PHP**  

A simple and time-saving script for downloading Lorem Ipsum images in bulk.  

### How to Use  
1. Ensure you have PHP installed.  
2. Place the script in the directory where you want to download the images.  
3. Run the following command in the terminal:  
   ```bash
   php lorem-picsum-download.php
   ```  
That's it! ðŸš€  

### Why This Script?  
I needed a fast, no-fuss solution to quickly download 100+ images for testing purposes. Unlike other tools with extensive settings and documentation, this script focuses on simplicity and efficiency.  

To show respect for the amazing Picsum service, the script sends only one request per second (up to 150 requests). I hope this small load won't cause any inconvenience.  

Enjoy!
